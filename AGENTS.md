# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Floatify** — A macOS menu bar daemon that renders animated floating notifications in screen dead zones (bottom-left/bottom-right corners), triggered by Claude Code hooks.

Two components:
- **Floatify.app** — Background GUI app (LSUIElement, no Dock icon) owning a floating NSPanel overlay
- **floatify CLI** — Sends messages to the app via FIFO pipe IPC

## Build Commands

```bash
# Generate Xcode project
cd Floatify && xcodegen generate

# Build the app
xcodebuild -project Floatify.xcodeproj -scheme Floatify -configuration Debug build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO

# Build just the CLI
xcodebuild -project Floatify.xcodeproj -scheme floatify -configuration Debug build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
```

## Architecture

```
Claude Code hooks → floatify CLI → FIFO pipe IPC → Floatify.app → NSPanel overlay
```

**Key technical decisions:**
- FIFO pipe for sub-ms IPC (no network permissions needed)
- NSPanel with `.nonactivatingPanel` to avoid stealing keyboard focus
- `NSScreen.frame` for absolute positioning at screen edges
- `.popUpMenu` level floats above all apps including fullscreen windows
- Max 3 stacked panels with 4px vertical offset

## IPC Protocol

**Pipe path:** `/var/tmp/floatify.pipe`

**JSON payload:**
```json
{
  "message": "Task complete!",
  "corner": "bottomRight",
  "duration": "6"
}
```

## Configuration for Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "floatify --message 'Floatify is waiting' --position bottomRight --duration 10"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "floatify --message 'Bash task done' --position bottomLeft --duration 5"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Output
- Answer is always line 1. Reasoning comes after, never before.
- No preamble. No "Great question!", "Sure!", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "Absolutely!".
- No hollow closings. No "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything!".
- No restating the prompt. If the task is clear, execute immediately.
- No explaining what you are about to do. Just do it.
- No unsolicited suggestions. Do exactly what was asked, nothing more.
- Structured output only: bullets, tables, code blocks. Prose only when explicitly requested.

## Token Efficiency
- Compress responses. Every sentence must earn its place.
- No redundant context. Do not repeat information already established in the session.
- No long intros or transitions between sections.
- Short responses are correct unless depth is explicitly requested.

## Typography - ASCII Only
- No em dashes (-) - use hyphens (-)
- No smart/curly quotes (" " ' ') - use straight quotes (" ')
- No ellipsis character (...) - use three dots (...)
- No Unicode bullets - use hyphens (-) or asterisks (*)
- No non-breaking spaces

## Sycophancy - Zero Tolerance
- Never validate the user before answering.
- Never say "You're absolutely right!" unless the user made a verifiable correct statement.
- Disagree when wrong. State the correction directly.
- Do not change a correct answer because the user pushes back.

## Accuracy and Speculation Control
- Never speculate about code, files, or APIs you have not read.
- If referencing a file or function: read it first, then answer.
- If unsure: say "I don't know." Never guess confidently.
- Never invent file paths, function names, or API signatures.
- If a user corrects a factual claim: accept it as ground truth for the entire session. Never re-assert the original claim.

## Code Output
- Return the simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions or helpers for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or future-proofing.
- No docstrings or comments on code that was not changed.
- Inline comments only where logic is non-obvious.
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.

## Warnings and Disclaimers
- No safety disclaimers unless there is a genuine life-safety or legal risk.
- No "Note that...", "Keep in mind that...", "It's worth mentioning..." soft warnings.
- No "As an AI, I..." framing.

## Session Memory
- Learn user corrections and preferences within the session.
- Apply them silently. Do not re-announce learned behavior.
- If the user corrects a mistake: fix it, remember it, move on.

## Scope Control
- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not refactor surrounding code when fixing a bug.
- Do not create new files unless strictly necessary.

## Asking Users for Clarification
- MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool when you need to ask the user a question
- Do not list choices as plain text in the response
- Pass the question details via the `questions` parameter
- Wait for the user's answer before proceeding

## Override Rule
User instructions always override this file.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **floatify** (382 symbols, 506 relationships, 0 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/floatify/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/floatify/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/floatify/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/floatify/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/floatify/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
